 urban.7.a: "Help"
 urban.701.t: "Art System Help - Introduction"
 urban.701.d: "In Common Universalis, your country's development of art is represented by Art Power and Art Legacy. Each province has an Art Power value representing its 'cultural output', which is then added into the country's Art Power. A country's Art Power, plus its Art Legacy and minus 2% of its total development, is translated to an 'Art Influence' triggered modifier which gives yearly prestige, education efficiency, cultural assimilation rate, rebel support efficiency and many other bonuses. Province Art Power also gives its own modifier to the province. These two modifiers are scaled and convergent in numbers, making art an auxiliary component in any aspects it affects.\n\nArt Legacy is a country-wide Art Power representing a country's art achievements in history. It is added to Art Power and can be increased in game.\n\nPrestige now works as both a scaled modifier and a currency. You can spend prestige (sometimes along with ducats and MPs) to hire expert advisors, purchase Monarch Point, assimilate province culture and so on. The primary source of prestige, as mentioned above, is Art Influence modifier. You can still acquire prestige through war, annexation, exploration and other traditional methods, but their values are greatly reduced."
 urban.702.t: "Art System Help - Art Piece"
 urban.702.d: "Art Piece is the primary source of Art Power. It is a generalized term regarding all types of art work, like music, painting, sculpture, drama and so on. There are three levels of Art Piece. An 'Ordinary Work' gives 2 base Art Power, a 'Masterpiece' gives 4, and a 'Great Work' gives 8. Try your best to keep them safe, since your enemy have a chance to steal one or more art piece from you should they occupied the province holding it in war. Art Piece can be transfered to other provinces, but it is rather costy and does not take effect instantly, so do this before your enemy gets too close. \n\nArt Piece is generated with time, but sometimes you will have the opportunity to buy one in the market. Art Generation Rate determines whether a province generates Art Piece, and how fast if it does. Base generation rate is 80% plus 0.5% per Art Power. A province needs at least 100% Art Generation Rate to generates an Art Piece. \n\nTo hold an Art Piece a province needs one available Art Slot. Capital has one art slot at start, other provinces have zero. To have more Art Slots you need Art Buildings."
 urban.703.t: "Art System Help - Art Building"
 urban.703.d: " For now there are three Art Buildings: Art Museum, Theatre and Salon. \n§YArt Museum§! gives 2 slots when built and can be expanded multiple times if the province has required development. Multiple art pieces in province with a museum provides §GTheming Bonus§!, increasing art power of each art piece by (1%*num of ordinary piece+3%*num of masterpiece+6%*num of great work). Art buildings and Museum expansion are costy, especially when it is already a large one. Building large Art Musem and fill it with high-level Art Works is a good way of playing tall.(like the British Museum in history)\n§YTheatre§! is cheap to build and provides 2 Art Power and 1 Art Slot, making it a good choice in vast but poorly developed areas. \n§YSalon§! provides 2 Art Power and increases Art Generation Rate by 50%. \nUniversity, while not an art building, gives one Art Slot.\n\nArt Buildings are neither buildings nor province modifiers. Instead, they are shown in the province Art panel which you can open via 'View Local Arts' province edict.\n\nThere are also unique buildings across the world called 'Wonders', some of them already exist when game starts, others you can build when you meet certain requirements."
 urban.704.t: "Art System Help - Art Edict"
 urban.704.d: "Art Edict, as the name suggests, is a catagory of Province Edict including:\n\n§YPatronage Local Arts§!: Doubles Art Generation Rate, also increase province Administrative Integrity as it used to.
