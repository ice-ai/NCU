 desc_artisan_regulation: "§RDisables §YFinancial Ideas§!, §YRenovation Ideas§! and §YQuality Ideas§!§!\n\nIn Ming China, artisan is not a free job to choose. The empire developed a regulation system that illegalized all unregistered artisans, and put almost all workshops under central administration. This system was gradually found rigid and ineffient - The artisans were locked in a low status, innovation was not encouraged, and the supervisors were always corrupted - which slowered Ming's progress towards capitalism and technological advancement. The regulation was weakened in late Ming, and finally revoked by Shunzhi emperor of the Qing dynasty."

 desc_trade_limitation: "§RDisables §YMaritime Ideas§! and §YTrade Ideas§!§!\n\nTrade activities were highly restricted in Ming and Qing dynasty, especially the foreign ones. Considering the oversea world as a source of heresy rather than treasury, Chinese emperors always kept a suspious eye on the growing merchant power along China's coastline, and issued policies that discouraged, harrassed or even destroyed those commercial activities, leaving those opportunity to other Asian countries and eventually the late-coming Europeans."

 desc_foreign_ignorance: "§RDisables §YDiplomatic Ideas§!, §YRenovation Ideas§! and §YUnion Ideas§!§!\n\nForeign affairs in east Asia were not like those in other parts of the world. China's enormous size, unmatched power and splendid culture put it into a supreme status, making the Chinese - and many others - believe that all other countries, large or small, are nothing but petty barbarians that can only bow before the celestial empire, and China, as their natural overlord, is obligated to protect and 'civilize' them. This foreign ignorance stayed unchallenged until the 19th centry, when Europeans finally discovered that this once mighty empire had already fallen into corrupcy and barbarism."
