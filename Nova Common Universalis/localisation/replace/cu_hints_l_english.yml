 HINT_CAVALRY_TEXT: "Cavalry is very strong early on in the game when their higher Shock means they will deal a noticeable amount of damage. If you do not have a certain mix of Infantry and Cavalry you will receive an Insufficient Support modifier that reduces the damage dealt by your troops. The amount of Infantry or Cavalry you can have depends on your Technology Group.\n\n§G−0.6§! per unrest friendly regiment at §Y100%§! maintenance, up to a maximum of §G−10§!.§YThe effect scales with maintenance level (§Rdown to zero at minimum maintenance§!).§!"
 HINT_ARTILLERY_TEXT: "Artillery are support regiments that help you siege provinces faster. They also provide 50% of their Shock and Fire (green pips) to help a unit in the front row take reduced damage when attacked. Artillery can also attack from the rear and they deal 50% of the damage. Artillery positioned in the front will take double damage when attacked.\n\n·§G−0.2§! per unrest friendly regiment at §Y100%§! maintenance, up to a maximum of §G−10§!.§YThe effect scales with maintenance level (§Rdown to zero at minimum maintenance§!).§!"
