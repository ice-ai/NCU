 celestial_reform.1.t: "Question of Celestial Empire Reform"
 celestial_reform.1.d: "If there is one thing we can learn from the fall of former Chinese dynasties, it is that they were all doomed to fall. The dynastic cycle is a natural course for all empires, just like life and death for each individual, its end being an inevitable disaster looming on the horizon, our horizon.\n\nAs Lao-tsu once said, Heaven is a ruthless being acting on its own law, never affected by the morality of man. Even if [Root.GetName] is the most powerful and just dynasty ever seen in Chinese history, it may still fall one day in the will of heaven. To avoid our downfall, we need to find out the law behind dynastic cycle, and reform accordingly."
 celestial_reform.1.a: "An academic discussion won't hurt..."
 celestial_reform.1.at: "Discuss the question of reform with ministers."
 celestial_reform.1.b: "Reform? Who needs reform?"
 celestial_reform.1.bt: "You can do it later via decision."
